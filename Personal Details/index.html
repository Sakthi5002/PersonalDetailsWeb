            Hello there. I am Sakthi. I am a student pursuing my B.Tech degree in Kumaraguru College of
            Technology, Coimbatore after completing my schooling in S.K.V Matriculation Higher Secondary School. I am
            interested in programming and I love gaming so much. This page is created to display my personal details.

                I love sports especially Cricket and Kabaddi. I like to watch movies in my freetime. I love to eat and
                yeah, who doesn't love that? I don't know why but
                I am so much interested in programming which made me dive deep into the world of coding. I have learnt
                C, C++, Python. I also tried web development through which I learnt HTML a bit. I am serious gamer. I
                love games so much and I never get tired of that. This craze about games and coding interest sparked me
                to learn game development too.

                As for now I have created many small programs for complex problems both in academics as well as
                competitive coding competions available online. I have also created games using unity engine by
                following tutorials. In web development I have hosted a website in which you can play the snake game. I
                will provide the link below.
